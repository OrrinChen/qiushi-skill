> Build agents that investigate first, focus on the main contradiction, validate in practice, and keep pushing until the work is actually done.

`qiushi-skill` is a collection of reusable methodology skills, commands, and session-start hooks. It turns a set of problem-solving methods into installable assets for Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, OpenCode, OpenClaw, Hermes Agent, and other prompt-driven hosts.

## Why This Exists

Many agents can generate text, but they still fail at disciplined work:

- they answer before collecting facts
- they scatter effort across too many tasks
- they stop at the first blocker
- they skip verification and call that "done"

`qiushi-skill` is meant to correct that with one core principle and nine concrete methods:

- `seeking truth from facts` as the governing principle
- contradiction analysis
- practice -> cognition -> practice iteration
- investigation first
- mass line feedback synthesis
- criticism and self-criticism
- protracted strategy
- concentrate forces
- spark a prairie fire
- overall planning


> Support author's other repo!: **[AcademicForge](https://github.com/HughYau/AcademicForge)**: **One Forge, All Skills.** An interactive, cross-platform tool to generate simple, one-click installation commands for multiple AI Agent Skills. 

## Install

### Preferred: `npx qiushi-skill`

```bash
npx qiushi-skill
```

Interactive by default: it detects installed hosts and copies into the right directories. Non-interactive:

```bash
npx qiushi-skill install --target claude-code --scope user
npx qiushi-skill install --target all --scope user
npx qiushi-skill uninstall --target claude-code
```

The CLI is zero-dependency and ships `validate` for self-checks. Skills-only targets use a `.qiushi-skill-install.json` manifest so uninstall removes only managed entries. Dedicated Claude Code and Cursor bundle roots are installed transactionally and must not be symlinks.

For the first upgrade from a supported manually copied Codex install (currently including the official 1.3.1 snapshot), run:

```bash
npx qiushi-skill install --target codex --scope user --adopt-legacy
```

The installer adopts only a complete skill directory tree matching a supported official snapshot (CRLF/LF differences in Markdown are normalized). It refuses extra or modified content, backs up the old directories under `.qiushi-skill-backups/`, and then writes the managed-install manifest. Later upgrades do not need this flag.

### Claude Code Official Marketplace

This repository now ships `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, so Claude Code can discover it directly from GitHub:

```text
/plugin marketplace add HughYau/qiushi-skill
/plugin install qiushi-skill@qiushi-skill
```

### Source Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HughYau/qiushi-skill
cd qiushi-skill
claude --plugin-dir .
```

### Other Hosts

The same CLI targets Cursor, Codex, OpenCode, OpenClaw, Hermes Agent, and nanobot (`--target cursor|codex|opencode|openclaw|hermes|nanobot|all`). Any host that reads Markdown skills can also just copy the `skills/` directory. Target paths and native entrypoints are listed in [`docs/platforms.md`](https://github.com/HughYau/qiushi-skill/blob/main/docs/platforms.md).

## Validate

Preferred:

```bash
npx qiushi-skill validate
```

If you are working from a source checkout, legacy fallback scripts are also available:

```bash
bash tests/validate.sh
# or on Windows
powershell -NoLogo -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tests/validate.ps1
```

Validation checks:

- JSON validity, including `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`
- version consistency between `package.json` and marketplace metadata
- presence of CLI files, hooks, commands, and the marketplace bundle
- frontmatter completeness for skills, commands, and agents
- local Markdown link integrity

## How to Use It

The session-start entry skill is `skills/arming-thought/SKILL.md`, a ~50-line always-on kernel. Its job is intentionally narrow:

1. enforce `seeking truth from facts` through four hard rules: claims follow evidence, separate fact / inference / unknown, verified means done, diagnose before giving up
2. route to a downstream skill only when it clearly helps; direct-execution tasks trigger nothing
3. defer to the host's own plan / review / todo flows when they exist

Every method skill keeps only five sections: **use / don't use** (trigger boundary), **procedure** (concrete actions), **output template** (an observable artifact), **discipline** (hard constraints), and **handoff** (which skill usually comes next). Original quotations and lookup guides live in sibling files and are loaded on demand.

Two host-discoverable sub-agents live in `agents/`: `investigator` (read-only, returns a fact / inference / unknown ledger) and `self-critic` (fresh-context reviewer that reads artifacts, not narratives).

Hosts that install only `skills/*`, including Codex, do not depend on those named templates. The relevant skills instead pass the same read-only or review contract to a generic sub-agent.

Manual command entrypoints live in `commands/*.md` for hosts that support Markdown slash commands.
